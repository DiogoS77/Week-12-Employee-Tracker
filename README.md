## Description

This project consists in a Employee Tracker that willd allow you to track your employees names, roles, salarys, assigned managers, departments and even let you update their roles. With this interactive database you will be able to get the information sorted in a easier way to understand and see the information. THis project contains 2 SQl files and 4 JavaScript files that are the ones giving the function.

This found multiple challenges during this project , since it was the hardest one untill now in my opinion. The biggest challenge was time management since this was a really big project that took some time to code it and there was no starter code during this week so it was definitly way harder to organise everything , to understand from where i should start and what i should do exactly. Another big challenge i faced was when i was having an issue that looked like i was not going to be able to solve it that took me 7 hours to actually solve it and get it fixed and the pressure and the frustration were affecting my way of thinking so i would say it was really hard.

This challenge helped me a lot because i felt way more confident after finishing and getting it to work, because i noticed the long way i have come and see that i was able to make something of this size and magnitude made me proud of myself and made me way more confident. ANother thing that this challenge helped me was my improvment in finding and solving issues since i had a pretty high number of issues and in the end i was able to fix them and get the project to work. I will also be listing other positive points in where this challenge helped me.

* Higher understanding of DataBases
* Higher understanding of Mysql
* Better JavaScript prespective
